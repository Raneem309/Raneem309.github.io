Hi, welcome to my online portfolio, completely developed by me, Raneem Ali. I utilized JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create every aspect of this fully functional website.

As you navigate through the portfolio, you’ll notice four main tabs at the top of the screen: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. You can access each tab using your pointer tool, and once a tab is active, its name transforms into a revolving square—this visual cue lets you know which section is currently on display.

When the site loads, you’re greeted with an opening screen that displays “Raneem Ali Portfolio.” On the Home page, you’ll find a revolving, rendered cube created with Three.js, setting the tone for the interactive experience.

The About Me section is designed with a two-part layout. On the left, you’ll see options for Professional Summary, Skills, Experience, and Education. When you select an option, the corresponding content appears on the right, updating each time you make a new selection. For example, my education is highlighted by my degree in Management Information Systems from George Mason University, where I focused on scalable software design while gaining hands-on experience with Python, Java, and AWS.

The Projects tab features three small applications developed specifically for this portfolio: Fit Mindset, Weather App, and Time Control. You can interact with each project by clicking its respective button:

Fit Mindset: This application lets you input basic data and receive your calculated BMI, BMR, and TDEE. It also allows you to restart the process after your initial submission.
Weather App: This tool provides a simple 5-day weather forecast for any city worldwide, using data from the free OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/). You can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit with a single click. If the API does not return data for a specified city, an error message will notify you that the information could not be retrieved.
Time Control: This is a functional stopwatch that enables you to start, stop, record laps, and reset the timer—all while the time is visually displayed and tracked.
Each application includes an EXIT button at the bottom, which allows you to return to the project options at any time.

Finally, the Contact tab provides all the ways to get in touch with me—phone number, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links—so you can connect easily.

This portfolio is a representation of the skills I have honed over the years. It not only showcases my technical expertise but also demonstrates my ability to integrate both past and newly learned skills into building a complete, interactive website.
